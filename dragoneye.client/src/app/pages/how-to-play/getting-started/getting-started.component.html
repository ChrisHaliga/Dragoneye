Welcome & What Makes This Different

This system prioritizes storytelling and character development over complex mechanics
Card-based resolution means you'll never need to memorize dozens of rules - everything you need is written on your cards
Simple multiplicative math replaces complicated modifiers and calculations
The seven-element framework creates intuitive relationships that are easy to learn and remember
Roleplaying drives the narrative, with mechanics supporting your character's story rather than constraining it

The Basics of Tabletop RPGs

The GM describes situations and environments while you control your character's actions and decisions
When outcomes are uncertain, you use cards and stats to determine results
Success comes from creative problem-solving, teamwork, and staying true to your character
The story emerges collaboratively through everyone's contributions at the table

What You Need to Prepare - Players

Create a character using the Character Creation section
Understand your character's elemental associations and chosen domain
Familiarize yourself with your starting action cards
Develop your character's personality, background, and motivations on the roleplay page
Think about what your character wants to achieve and how they approach problems
Prepare to describe actions in character rather than purely mechanical terms

What You Need to Prepare - Game Masters

Read through Core Mechanics and Combat sections thoroughly
Plan story scenarios that highlight different player character strengths
Prepare NPCs with clear motivations rather than just stat blocks
Understand how element interactions create natural story conflicts
Think about pacing between roleplay scenes and action sequences
Have resolution cards ready for uncertain outcomes

Understanding the Seven Elements

The Primary Cycle: Earth (Geo) beats Water (Hyd) beats Fire (Pyr) beats Air (Æro) beats Earth
Light vs Dark: Light (Lux) and Dark (Nyx) oppose each other in eternal conflict
The Mysterious Arcane: Arcana (Arc) interacts with all other elements in complex ways
Your character's elemental associations determine strengths, weaknesses, and story themes
Different races, regions, and abilities connect to specific elements
Understanding these relationships helps you make tactical and narrative decisions

What a Typical Session Looks Like

Sessions begin with a brief recap and check-in on character goals
The GM describes the current situation while players ask questions and gather information
Players declare what their characters want to do based on personality and motivations
Simple actions succeed automatically if characters are capable
Uncertain outcomes use card resolution with stat bonuses
Combat and complex challenges follow structured procedures but emphasize roleplay
Sessions alternate between character interaction, exploration, and action scenes
Downtime allows for character development and relationship building
