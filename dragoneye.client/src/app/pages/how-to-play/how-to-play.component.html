    <h2>What is This Game?</h2>
    <p>Age of Chaos/Order/Ascension is a medieval fantasy TTRPG that evolves across three distinct historical eras. Play as heroes navigating warring kingdoms (Chaos), bureaucratic guild systems (Order), or industrial corporate dystopia (Ascension).</p>
    <p>Everything revolves around seven elements: Earth (Geo), Water (Hyd), Fire (Pyr), Air (Æro), Light (Lux), Dark (Nyx), and Arcana (Arc).</p>
    <p class="emphasis">This is a "roleplaying game" and <strong>roleplaying</strong> always comes before <strong>game</strong>.</p>

    <h2>The Seven-Element System</h2>
    <p>All character races, attributes, continents, and action types connect to the seven elements. Elements interact in rock-paper-scissors relationships. Your character's elemental associations shape their strengths, weaknesses, and story role.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Describe what your character wants to do based on their personality, training, and abilities</li>
      <li>Skill checks, combat, and other challenges are resolved using action/resolution cards plus your character's stat bonuses</li>
