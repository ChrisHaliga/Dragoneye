        <p class="lead text-muted">An era of technological transformation and corporate control, where magic has been disguised as technology and freedom traded for convenience.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">Traditional magic has been outlawed and nearly forgotten, branded as dangerous and primitive. In its place, "technology" harnesses the same forces through safer, more predictable means. Most people carry devices of incredible power without recognizing them as magical artifacts. The few remaining true mages are outcasts and relics.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">The old Guild transformed into competing mega-corporations that control every aspect of life. Race and species have become irrelevant - your value is determined by your access to technology and your position in the corporate hierarchy. Vast inequality exists between the connected elite and the struggling masses.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">People live in a hyper-connected world of constant surveillance and convenience. Work is either high-tech specialization or service jobs supporting the wealthy. Entertainment, communication, and even basic needs are mediated through corporate-controlled technology. Traditional skills are hobbies for the rich.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">Violence has been replaced by economic warfare and social control. Revolutions are quietly suppressed through a combination of surveillance, comfort, and targeted intervention. The greatest danger is not external threat but the slow erosion of freedom in exchange for security and convenience.</p>
