        </div>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">The arcane arts have been tamed and systematized. The Adventurer's Guild created the first magical universities, standardized spellcasting techniques, and established licensing for practitioners. Magic went from mysterious art to learned profession, as common as literacy among the educated classes.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">When the Demon King threatened all civilization, old enemies became allies out of necessity. The Guild, born from this crisis, never relinquished the authority it gained. While kingdoms still exist, real power flows through Guild hierarchies and adventuring licenses. The world has become more cosmopolitan - racial tensions matter less when everyone faces the same demonic threat.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">Life revolves around Guild structures. Adventuring is a career path with ranks, benefits, and standardized procedures. Monsters are managed resources, their parts harvested for regulated markets. Even mundane problems are solved through posted bounties and certified professionals.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">Wars have been replaced by political maneuvering within Guild bureaucracy. Ambitious individuals scheme for promotions rather than territories. The greatest threats are administrative corruption, inter-departmental rivalries, and the ever-present but slow-burning Demon King crisis that justifies the Guild's existence.</p>
