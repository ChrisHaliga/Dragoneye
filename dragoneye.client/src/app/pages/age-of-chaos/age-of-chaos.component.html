        </div>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">Magic is woven into the fabric of the world, but few mortals can harness it. Wizards are rare and mysterious figures - some hermits in towers, others court advisors, all wielding power that common folk barely understand. There are no academies or guilds, just masters and apprentices, ancient bloodlines, and dangerous experimentation.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-0">Society</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">The continent is a patchwork of human kingdoms built on conquest. Humans arrived from across the seas and carved out their domains through war, displacing the native dwarves, elves, orcs, and other peoples who now live as minorities in lands they once ruled. Kings clash over territory while nobles plot in shadowed halls.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">Most people are farmers, craftsmen, or soldiers living under the protection of their lord's castle. Monsters lurk in dark forests and ancient ruins. Adventurers are the bold few who venture into danger for gold and glory, clearing dungeons and slaying beasts that threaten the realm.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="fs-5 lh-lg">Problems are solved with blade and spell. Dragons terrorize the countryside, undead rise from forgotten battlefields, and dark cults serve alien gods. Wars rage between kingdoms while bandits prey on the weak. Heroes forge legends by facing these threats head-on.</p>
